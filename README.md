CyberBullying Detection and Content Moderation System

Our project addresses this challenge through the development of a Hate Speech Detection and Auto Deletion system. The primary goal of this system is to automatically recognize and remove hate speech, cyberbullying, and offensive language from user-generated comments, thereby creating a safer and more respectful online environment.
