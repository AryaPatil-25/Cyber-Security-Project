**CyberBullying Detection and Content Moderation System**

Our project addresses this challenge through the development of a Hate Speech Detection and Auto Deletion system. The primary goal of this system is to automatically recognize and remove hate speech, cyberbullying, and offensive language from user-generated comments, thereby creating a safer and more respectful online environment.

Objectives:
1. Develop and implement a robust hate speech detection model
2. Automate the deletion process for identified hate speech content
3. Analyze the impact of cultural context on hate speech detection
4. Safeguard the balance between freedom of expression and online safety
5. Provide recommendations for improving the efficiency and accuracy of hate speech
